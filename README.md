# Blockopoly - A Blockchain-based Approach to Land Registry

Real Estate is a cornerstone of the global economy, representing a significant portion of wealth and being a major factor in any country’s GDP. Yet, despite being one of the most important sectors, it is still one of the most outdated. The traditional process of land conveyance is cumbersome, slow, and expensive, primarily due to the fragmentation of information across various controlling entities. 
There’s a need to have this data unified in a single shared database that all the relevant parties may access and contribute, but none fully controls. This study explores the potential benefits of using blockchain technology for this purpose and proposes a novel smart contract architecture for a permissioned blockchain network implemented with Hyperledger Fabric. 
The presented solution comprises land conveyance and renting functionalities and demonstrates how its application could bring increased efficiency, transparency, and trustworthiness over legacy systems.
